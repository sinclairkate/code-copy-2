<h1>Code Copy #2 | 25 Points | Due Friday, January 13, 2017</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Continue to polish HTML and CSS skills by copying the apple.com homepage.</p>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Read all the directions here before starting.</li>
  <li>Download this repository.</li>
  <li>Open the image named 'code-copy-2.png' and study it closely. You will be attempting to make an exact replica of this design, replacing the image with one of your choosing. Open the image named 'help.jpg' and study it closely. This is a wireframe I made for you to help get you started.</li>
  <li>Open the file named 'index.html' from this repository. For this Code Copy, you may write your CSS in a <code>style</code> tag within the <code>head</code> tag OR you may put your css in an external CSS file, just be sure to link it properly in your html file.</li>
  <li>DO NOT worry about any extra functionality - like the main rotating image, the search bar or the bag icon - we are not there yet.</li>
  <li>Recreate the design you see in 'code-copy-2.png' using only HTML and CSS. Upload your files to this github repository when you are finished. You MAY NOT directly copy and paste code from apple.com's website. The point of this exercise is to practice your skills.</li>
  <li>We will go over this next week.</li>
</ol>
